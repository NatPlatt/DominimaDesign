        <p class="background">My husband and I started <strong>DominimaDesign</strong> about 3 years ago. My husband got into <a href="attend.html#learn">3D printing</a> just as a hobby, and we figured we should make things to sell to have an excuse to keep printing. We decided to design and print low-poly animals and later cars because we like the minimalist look and thought others would as well. Once we had a few prints done we started our Etsy Shop, and have continued printing and designing ever since.</p>
