        <h1 id="learn">What is 3D-Printing</h1>
        <p>Also known as additive manufacturing, is the process of making three-dimensional objects from a digital file by adding successive layers of different kinds of material, until the full object is formed. We use a material called <a href="https://all3dp.com/1/pla-filament-3d-printing/" target="_blank">PLA</a>, a type of plastic filament, in our prints.</p>
        <h2>Other materials you can print with are:</h2>
            <ul class="materials">
                <li>Metals</li>
                <li>Carbon fiber</li>
                <li>Graphene</li>
                <li>Water-absorbing plastic</li>
                <li>Stem cells</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Other forms of 3D Printing</h2>  <!-- So that the user has a better idea of what they're buying-->
        <p class="description">We use FDM printing to print our products, but there are lots of other methods of 3D-printing.The eight most common types used by hobbyists like ourselves are:</p>
            <ul class="types">
                <li>FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling)</li>
                <li>Vat Polymerization</li>
                <li>SLA (Stereolithography)</li>
                <li>DLP (Digital Light Processing))</li>
                <li>Powder Bed Fusion (Polymers)</li>
                <li>SLS (Selective Laser Sintering)</li>
                <li>MJ (Material Jetting)</li>
                <li>DOD (Drop on Demand)</li>
            </ul>

        <p class="description">To 3D-print something, first you have to design it on the computer. Here are some common programs that are used to design prints.</p>
            <dl>
                <dt><a href="https://www.blender.org/" target="_blank">Blender</a></dt>
                <dd>This is the program we use. It is a free and open source 3D creation site. It supports the entirety of the 3D pipeline-modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing, and motion tracking, even video and game creation.</dd>
                
                <dt><a href="https://www.sketchup.com/" target="_blank">Sketchup</a></dt>
                <dd>A program where you start by drawing lines and shapes, the push and pull surfaces to create 3D forms.</dd>
                
                <dt><a href="https://www.solidworks.com/" target="_blank">SolidWorks</a></dt>
                <dd>A solid modeling computer-aided design and computer-aided engineering program that runs on Windows.</dd>
